Place your logo/image files here with the following filenames to make them active in the app:

- favicon.ico      -> will be used as browser favicon
- logo192.png      -> used by PWA and header (we reference this in the header)
- logo512.png      -> used by PWA for high-DPI devices

Tip: Preferred input is SVG or a high-resolution square PNG (>=512x512). If you'd like, I can generate the resized PNGs and favicon from the uploaded image for you — give me permission to write those files and I'll create them now.
